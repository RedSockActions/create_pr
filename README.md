## Purpose
This GitHub Action provides an automated mechanism for
Pull Request creation. 

The action won't create and won't try to create
already existing "branch_from" pull requests

## Usage
Quick start documentation with examples can be
found [here](https://redsockactions.github.io/redocs/#/Quick%20Start/Github%20action)
